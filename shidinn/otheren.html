	<h1>Differences between Shidinn Chinese and Shidinn Mandarin</h1>
	<p>“Shidinn” usually refers to the “new Chinese language of the Shidinn alphabet”, but it is not just the “new Chinese language of the Shidinn alphabet” (“Shidinn Chinese” (希顶华语) also refers to “Shidinn”) that uses the Shidinn language (“Shidinn alphabetic language”), because there is also the “old Mandarin of the Shidinn alphabet” (希顶字母旧汉语) (or just “Shidinn Mandarin” (希顶汉语). Zhihu user @Kosmas calls this “Shidenn” (希灯语). This name is more accurate, so it is used in Shidinnology).
		<br>
		<br> Shidinn Mandarin is just taking the Pinyin of the words in Standard Chinese and removing the tones of them, changing them into transcriptions that fit the rules of the Shidinn alphabet, and adding the “radical letters” (the Shidinn letter that a Hanzi randical corresponds to) after each word. For example:
		<br> (Standard Chinese) 萤火虫
		<br> → (Standard Pinyin) yíng huǒ chóng
		<br> → (removing the tones) ying huo chong
		<br> → (converting into the Shidinn alphabet)
		<p2 class="xdi8">y8 ho D3</p2> (alternatively
		<p2 class="xdi8">ci3</p2>, Shidinn Mandarin keeps some Pinyin letters)
		<br> → (the radical of 萤 is 虫, corresponding to the letter "k")
		<p2 class="xdi8">y8k ho D3</p2> (
		<p2 class="xdi8">y8k ho ci3</p2>).
		<br>
		<br> Shidinn Mandarin (Shidenn) serves as the transition langauge between Standard Chinese and Standard Shidinn (Shidinn Chinese). It does not have its own set of unique grammar and semantics, so rather than calling Shidinn Mandarin (Shidenn) a language, it would be better to call it a code or a dialect.
		<br>
		<br>However, forming syllables in Shidinn Chinese is different from Mandarin, and some of its characters are loaned, created or is a proper noun (“纟火” in the name of Shidinn, meaning “burning fire of a lantern” is an example of this). Shidinn has its own set of unique grammar, for example:
		<br>Negation of adjectives can be marked by putting a
		<p2 class="xdi8">N</p2> in front: 大 (big) is da and 不大 (not big) is
		<p2 class="xdi8">Nda</p2>.
		<br> Any nouns can be used as adjectives, such as 火亮火亮的 →
		<p2 class="xdi8">ho-viTH ho-viTH de</p2> (this word can be translated to Standard Chinese as 叫得山响 (to shout deafeningly). In Shidinn, that would be
		<p2 class="xdi8">7i6o FeV s2-opiT</p2>).
		<br>
		<br>However, Huang Quefei has never described more about this systematically, so the conclusion and introduction stops here. Zhihu user @Raymond thinks that, if Huang Quefei were to expand more on the grammar and make it more systematic, and can flexibly use created characters, Shidinn has the possibility of becoming a full-fledged conlang.</p>
	<h1>Loanwords</h1>
	<p>Shidinn alphabetic languages use transliterate or direct transcription for loanwords. Such words can be surrounded with angle brackets “⟨⟩” so as not to confuse them with non-loanwords. For example: Lhasa is 拉萨 in Standard Chinese, in which 拉 and 萨 is
		<p2 class="xdi8">la8</p2> and
		<p2 class="xdi8">sa18</p2> respectively in Shidinn Chinese, but because this is a loanword in Shidinn, it just needs to be transliterated to “⟨Lasa⟩”, no radicals needed. It can also directly transcribe the Latin letters into “⟨Lhasa⟩”. Using the same method, Singapore can be “⟨X8gapiod⟩” or “⟨Singapore⟩”. For country names, one can take the original English name’s first three letters (with the first letter capitalized) and add “go”. If this were used, angle brackets don't have to be added. An example of this is 新加坡 (Singapore) → “Singo”.</p>
	<h1>Numerals</h1>
	<p>The Arabic numerals 1-8 have letters of similar shapes in the Shidinn alphabet, so when writing numbers in the Shidinn alphabet, one can just write the corresponding lowercase letters, and one pronounces them as if they’re letters. The Arabic numeral 9 is
		<p2 class="xdi8">q</p2> in Shidinn, and 0 is
		<p2 class="xdi8">T</p2>. To differentiate numbers with non-numbers, a horizontal line is written below the numbers. For example, 十八 (18) is
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>18</u></p2> (/ɯẽɪ̃:/), 三百 (300) is
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>3TT</u></p2> (/ʔə̃ʊ̃ ʔɐ̃ ʔɐ̃/) and so on. Decimal points are represented by the letter "n". For example, 四点九五 (4.95) is
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>4nq5</u></p2> (/ʔeɲitɕʰiŋu/). Writing out the Heavenly Stems and the Earthly Branches also require writing a line below it, writing out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Stems">Heavenly Stems</a> requires putting
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2> in front, while writing out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Branches">Earthly Branches</a> requires putting
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2> after. For example,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>H1</u></p2>-
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>H8</u></p2>,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>Hq</u></p2>,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>HT</u></p2> represent the Heavenly Stems from Jia (甲) to Gui (癸), and
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>1H</u></p2> -
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>8H</u></p2>,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>qH</u></p2>,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>TH</u></p2>,
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>nH</u></p2> (representing the 11th branch Xu (戌)) and
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>vH</u></p2> (the 12th branch Hai (亥)) represent the Earthly Branches from Zi (子) to Hai (亥). 甲午 (Jiawu) is
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>H17H</u></p2> (/nzɹ̩ɯtʰunzɹ̩/) and 戊戌 (Wuxu) is
		<p2 class="xdi8"><u>H5nH</u></p2> (/nzɹ̩ŋuɲinzɹ̩/) and so on.</p>
	<h1>Shidinn Phonetic Hanzi and Shidinn Alphabetic Expression Hanzi</h1>
	<p>Shidinn Phonetic Hanzi (希顶形音汉字) takes the Shidinn alphabet writing system and stylizes it to a form similar to Chinese characters. It is another way of writing Shidinn (like taking Hanzi case and writing it into blocks). Huang Quefei calls this “the Han-ification of the western alphabet”. In the picture below, we can see that we can use the Shidinn Phonetic Hanzi to write “
		<p2 class="xdi8">⇧xdi8 Aho FHLmA</p2> ” (希顶字母) and other text.</p>

		<br>
		<br> The Shidinn Alphabetic Expression Hanzi (希顶字母表形字) uses Shidinn letters (uppercase, lowercase, Hanzi case or its corresponding radical/form radical) to form Hanzi glyphs, and it’s similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biaoxingma_method">the Biaoxingma input method</a> invented by French-Chinese scholar Chen Aiwen in the 1980s. For example, 命 is Aop, because the three “components” of 命 looks like the Shidinn letters A, o and p), while 希 and 顶 is XAM and Jr respectively. The reason why the 页 radical uses "r", is because "r" when used as a radical can represent 攵 and 页. </p>
	<h1>Resources and materials</h1>
	<p>Shidinn is a personal work of Huang Quefei. The number of speakers of Shidinn is unknown at this moment, but there are many resources and materials about Shidinn on the Internet.
		<br>
		<br> On Februrary 2020, after the publishing of <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/106197567">Revealing the Secret of the Shidinn Language</a> (《揭秘希顶语》), due to its unique idea of eliminating homophones in Standard Chinese, or possibly the charm of its “so chaotic it’s cute” system, it attracted the attention of <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/UntW">@UntPhesoca</a>, <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/icarus-34">@ICARUS</a> and many more linguists, and also the attention of linguistics lovers like <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/mo-kong-qing-85">@東宵來影</a>. And thus people began “developing” and “building” Shidinn.
		<br>
		<br> On September 2020, <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/thanco">@然後</a> and <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/edward-chen-53">@Nyoeghau</a> created the Zhihu “Shidinn” topic. In the same moth, Huang Quefei created his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili">Bilibili</a> account, with the accounts “黄雀飞” and “雨心浪子”.
		<br>
		<br>On October 2020, Zhihu users such as <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/ching-hung-ng">@Ching-hung Ng</a> asked questions about “compilations of Shidinn-related findings”, so using this opportunity, the “Shidinn” topic became a page for compiling Shidinn-related findings. In the same month, <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/chou-zi-kang-ano">@仇子康</a> 和 <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/musiclxzmr">@Raymond</a> discussed about creating a fictional timeline about the “Shidinnians” (希顶人) and the “Shidinn culture” (希顶文化) setting:</p>
	<p3>
		<div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">The traditional forces of the Hanzi-using Shidinnians and the Latin letter-using Shidinnian Catholics had a civil war. Because of the division between the traditional forces and the Catholic forces, many differences appear in usages in Shidinn in that timeline, in sound, text and loanwords.
			<br> (@仇子康)
			<br>
			<br> The Shidinnians who used Latin letters can speak one Shidinn dialect, the Shidinnians who used Chinese characters used Chinese characters and later “Shinom” (希喃) (hypothesis), and now it’s Hanzi case Shidinn. Shidinn languages using Chinese characters have always used the phonology of the Shaoyang dialect as the learning target, and the Catholic Shidinn language have always used the phonology of Latin (or even Hebrew?), but no one knew that “Proto-Shidinn” (原始希顶语) had consonant clusters.
			<br> (@Raymond)</div>
	</p3>
	<p>December 2020 update: Shidinn contributor @Raymond has created 3 new letters for use of foreign languages, which are
		<p2 class="xdi8alt">⇧th th</p2> /θ/,
		<p2 class="xdi8alt">⇧9 9</p2> /θu/ and
		<p2 class="xdi8alt">⇧hu hu</p2> /xu/. Thus the phonology is changed to this:</p>

		<p>The state of development of Shidinn and Shidinn culture: Right now, Shidinn isn’t just a fantasy of just Huang Quefei himself. To make a pseudoscientist’s language systematic and standardized, we had to form a “Shidinn group” of many people (originally five), or in fancy words, a “Shidinn team”. The crew includes:
			<br> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/edward-chen-53">@Nyoeghau</a> – font, translator, input method, related readings and culture promotion
			<br> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/chou-zi-kang-ano">@仇子康</a> – programming tutorials, creation of Shidinn culture
			<br> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/yin-jing-57-65">@窨井</a> – the Shidinn Tibetan writing system
			<br> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/kosmasdiogenes">@Kosmas</a> – the Shidinn Arabic writing system and management of detail problems
			<br> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/musiclxzmr">@Raymond</a> – organizing documents, reading samples and the Shidinn Kana writing system
