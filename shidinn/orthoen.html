	<h1>The Shidinn Alphabet</h1>
	<p>One of the most common ways of writing Shidinn is the Shidinn alphabet, which contains 45 letters. Some of the characters are taken from Latin, but some of them are created by Huang Quefei instead. </p>

	<p>(Note: The serifed glyphs reflect the true glyphs of the letters. The san-serif glyphs have not been updated and should not be used as a guide to the glyphs.)
		<br>
		<br>The letters of the Shidinn alphabet is the pronunciation of the letter plus the pronunciation of its Hanzi, called its Hanzi case (汉写体), in Shidinn Mandarin. For example, the Hanzi case of the letter A is 大, which is pronounced “da” in Shidinn Mandarin. Therefore, the name of the letter A is “A-da”. The hyphen is here to differentiate it from “Ada”, which is a word, instead of a letter.
		<br>
		<br>The shapes of the Shidinn letters are similar to those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary">Cherokee</a>, a writing system invented by native Cherokee linguist Sequoyah in the early 19th century. However, Shidinn and Cherokee are fundamentally different. Cherokee is a syllabary, and apart from a single letter forming a syllable, Shidinn also references Hanyu Pinyin and some abugidas by using multiple letters to form a syllable. </p>
	<h1>Shidinn Hanzi</h1>
	<p>Another method of writing Shidinn is Shidinn Hanzi (希顶汉字) and the Shidinn Phonetic Hanzi (希顶表音方块字), shown in the image below.</p>
	<center><img src="Images/1.jpg" alt="An example of Shidinn Hanzi." style="width:713px; height:350px;">
		<br> </center>
	<p>(Image courtesy of @Raymond in Zhihu)
		<br>
		<br>The characters 希顶字母, can be written in the Shidinn alphabet as
		<p2 class="xdi8">⇧xdi8 ⇧aho ⇧fHLmA</p2> (the line of blue text at the top), but it can also be written in Shidinn Hanzi as 灯⿰纟火字母 (the black text at the middle), and it can also be written in the Shidinn Phonetic Hanzi as ⿰火⿳刀工月 ⿰纟⿱九口 ⿱⿱宀下尺 ⿱巾女 (the orange text at the bottom).
		<br>
		<br>The design of Shidinn Hanzi is similar to Chu Nom, a Vietnamese writing system that uses Chinese characters that has gotten out of use. Characters created in Chu Nom follow the phonosemantic compounding rule, for example, the word for “mother” in Vietnamese sounds like 美 (mẹ), and by adding the 女 radical from Chinese, we get {女美}. Shidinn Hanzi uses a method similar to Chu Nom. However, the radicals in Shidinn Hanzis are pronounced too. Imagine if Mandarin borrowed {女美} from Chu Nom, but instead of měi, it is pronounced as nǚ měi. (Shidinn reconstruction:
		<p2 class="xdi8">AmeV</p2>, in which the
		<p2 class="xdi8">A</p2> is the radical which is related to females).
		<br>
		<br>From the above text, we know that a Shidinn Hanzi (or a syllable of a Shidinn alphabetic language) consists of a semantic radical (部首) and a phonetic radical (声部, referred to as 形部, “form radical” in Shidinn Chinese). For example, the character 思 is pronounced as
		<p2 class="xdi8">siF</p2> in Shidinn Mandarin (si is from Standard Chinese sī, and the radical
		<p2 class="xdi8">F</p2> represents inner feelings), and in Shidinn Chinese, it is seen as a form radical and is pronounced as nua. In Shidinn Chinese, the glyph shapes of Shidinn characters no longer have a relation to the pronunciation in Standard Chinese, and its pronunciation follows a comparison table of (allegedly) 1400+ characters devised by Huang Quefei. From this, we can make new Shidinn characters, like 偲, which is
		<p2 class="xdi8">Hnua</p2> (the radical of people-related things “人” and the form radical 思, which is pronounced nua). Also, in the table, there exists cases of loaning (假借), for example, 友 is loaned from 发 as the same form radical. This makes it harder to find patterns between Pinyin and form radicals, but this is just a feature of Shidinn itself.
		<br>
		<br>There are two methods to convert between Shidinn Hanzi and the Shidinn alphabet: phonosemantic compounding and pictographic. Phonosemantic compounding, as explained before, is putting the radical letter and the phonetic radical (or form radical) together.
		<br>房 ＝ 户 – buildings and clothes (p) + 方 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">fT</p2>) ＝
		<p2 class="xdi8">pfT</p2>
		<br>玲 ＝ 王 – jade and stone (
		<p2 class="xdi8">3</p2>) + 令 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">li8</p2>) ＝
		<p2 class="xdi8">3li8</p2>
		<br>晨 ＝ 日 – natural phenomena (b) + 辰 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">Bi8</p2>) ＝
		<p2 class="xdi8">bBi8</p2>
		<br> (Note: the radicals in Shidinn actually refer to the Shidinn letter used for radicals, which doesn’t have any connection to Chinese radicals. For example, the radical for natural phenomena is b, and no matter if the Hanzi is written as 日, 白, 风 or 光, it’s still the same radical)
		<br>
		<br> In phonosemantic compounding, if the radical is at the front, then it is connected to the phonetic radical (or form radical). If it is at the back, then the phonetic radical (or form radical) represents the entire pronunciation, as shown below.
		<br> 瓦 ＝ wa
		<br> 咓 ＝ owa (口 + 瓦)
		<br> 哇 ＝ wao (“哇” + 口)
		<br> This “encoding” method makes Shidinn have a “Hanzi input method” feeling to it. However, apart from making it “flexible”, it also creates a blending situation. In the above example, the rarely used character 咓 and commonly used characters 瓦 and 哇 have similar forms and pronunciations, but this is just a feature of Shidinn itself.
		<br>
		<br> Even worse, there exists a Simplified and Traditional problem. Because if a Chinese character has different forms when written in Simplified or Traditional, each of their form has their own “encoding”. For example:
		<br> 爱 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">4YF</p2>) ←→ 愛 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">4YFH</p2>)
		<br> 杀 (sa) ←→ 殺 (
		<p2 class="xdi8">7sa</p2>)
		<br> Shidinn also has a pictographic (and pictophonetic) “encoding system” for “irregular pictograms and special onomatopoeia” (as per Huang Quefei). Huang Quefei himself lists two examples, which are:
		<br> 香 ＝ h (禾 radical) +
		<p2 class="xdi8">T</p2> (Hanzi case is 日, because of its shape) ＝
		<p2 class="xdi8">hT</p2>. This is the pictographic system.
		<br> 乒乓 ＝ Pinyin pīngpāng ＝
		<p2 class="xdi8">pi8pT</p2> → adding the “onomatopoiea radical” (口 radical, o) →
		<p2 class="xdi8">⇧opi8⇧opT</p2>. According to Huang Quefei, this “O” is middlecase. In addition from uppercase, lowercase and Hanzi case, there is also middlecase, but it is rarely used. @Raymond thinks that, if one cannot use middlecase, then they can use the hyphen “-” to write it as
		<p2 class="xdi8">o-pi8pT</p2>.
		<br>
		<br> Shidinn alphabetic languages’ writing uses morphemes to separate words (in Chinese, that would be “以 语素 为 单位 的 分词 方式”), and they are sometimes pronounced wrongly. For example, “
		<p2 class="xdi8">53Fyu2</p2>” (心愿, wish) consists of “
		<p2 class="xdi8">53</p2>”(心) and “
		<p2 class="xdi8">Fyu2</p2>” (愿). If one were to split it as “
		<p2 class="xdi8">53F</p2>” and “
		<p2 class="xdi8">yu2</p2>”, then there would be words that don’t exist. Huang Quefei calls this phenomenon “fake words”. @Raymond thinks that, to prevent fake words, one should put hyphens to separate word, such as “
		<p2 class="xdi8">53-Fyu2</p2>”. Writers can use hyphens to prevent this depending on the situation.</p>
	<h1>Created characters of Shidinn Hanzi</h1>
	<p>Shidinn Hanzi is the Chinese character writing system of Shidinn, which contains many characters Huang Quefei made (exact number unknown). The {纟火} shown before (aho in the Shidinn alphabet) is one example. This is comparable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji#Kokuji">Kokujis</a>. However, creating characters in Shidinn is more flexible. In general, any character that consists of a radical and a Hanzi component can be turned into Shidinn, creating a new character. The example below shows this.</p>

		<br>
		<br>This is just taking “热烈欢迎新同学！” and changing some components to form new characters. Some of the characters don’t exist, but Shidinn writings and readings of these can still be reconstructed (reconstructed by @Raymond, may differ from the official reconstruction by Huang Quefei).
		<br> ⿱⿰丸斤灬:
		<p2 class="xdi8">hj8x</p2> (pictograph “丸”, “九”→ h; “斤” as sound →
		<p2 class="xdi8">j8</p2>; radical “灬” → x)
		<br> ⿱⿰子刂灬:
		<p2 class="xdi8">Flix</p2> (pictograph “子”→
		<p2 class="xdi8">F</p2>; radical “刂”→ l, filler vowel i; radical “灬” → x)
		<br> 扻:
		<p2 class="xdi8">8q2</p2> (radical “扌”→
		<p2 class="xdi8">8</p2>; “欠” as sound →
		<p2 class="xdi8">q2</p2>)
		<br> ⿺辶歹:
		<p2 class="xdi8">zdY</p2> (radical “辶”→ z; “歹” as sound →
		<p2 class="xdi8">dY</p2>)
		<br> ⿰亲又:
		<p2 class="xdi8">q82H</p2> (“亲” as sound → q8; pictograph “又”→
		<p2 class="xdi8">2</p2>; radical-less filler letter:
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2>)
		<br> ⿱⿱⺍冖卬:
		<p2 class="xdi8">3fTH</p2> (pictograph “⺍”→“三”→
		<p2 class="xdi8">3</p2>; radical “冖”→ f; “卬” as sound →
		<p2 class="xdi8">T</p2>; radical-less filler letter:
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2>)
		<br>
		<br> Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wubi_method">Wubi input method</a>, Shidinn can basically “encode” all new Chinese characters using at most 4 letters. Based on this thinking, Huang Quefei came up with the idea of replacing English letters with Shidinn letters for the base alphabet of computer programming, this became an important part of “Shidinnology” (希顶学). Something worth mentioning is that most of these new Chinese characters don’t have meanings yet, so if Huang Quefei were to give all of these meanings in later developmenet, then the semantic range of Shidinn may expand greatly. </p>
