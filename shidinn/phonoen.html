	<p> All consonants except labials can be labialized, and it’s marked by adding u to the end of the consonant, but with exceptions:
		<br>
		<br> /tʷ/ is written
		<p2 class="xdi8">F</p2> .
		<br> /tʷʰ/ is written
		<p2 class="xdi8">7</p2> .
		<br> /nʷ/ is written v.
		<br> /kʷ/ is written
		<p2 class="xdi8">B</p2> .
		<br> /kʷʰ/ is written c.
		<br> /ŋʷ/ is written
		<p2 class="xdi8">5</p2> .
		<br> The labialized version of y is pronounced /ɥ/.
		<br> The labialized version of h is pronounced /ɧ/.
		<br> The labialized version of
		<p2 class="xdi8">4i</p2> is written
		<p2 class="xdi8">4u</p2> and is pronounced /ɥ̈/. </p>
	<br>
	<h1>Glides</h1>
	<p> There are 5 glides:
		<br>
		<br> /j/ - i except for any of the situations below.
		<br> /ɥ/ - i after labialized consonants except for any of the situations below.
		<br> /j̈/ - i after unlabialized velar consonants. If there is a
		<p2 class="xdi8">E</p2> after an unlabialized velar consonant, then /j̈/ is inserted between, like
		<p2 class="xdi8">gE</p2> /kj̈i/.
		<br> /ɥ̈/ - i after labialized velar consonants. If there is a
		<p2 class="xdi8">E</p2> after a labialized velar consonant, then /ɥ̈/ is inserted between, like
		<p2 class="xdi8">BE</p2> /kʷɥ̈i/.
		<br> /ɹ̠/ - i after w and f.
		<br>
		<br> /ɹ̠/ is a consonant that can only be used for glides. It is a postalveolar approximant, which has a bit of labialization as in /ʃ/, but it is in fact labiodentalized here, as below:
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">w2</p2> /ʋæ̃/ 万
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">f2</p2> /fæ̃/ 反
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">wi2</p2> /ʋɹ̠æ̃/ 宛
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">fi2j</p2> /fɹ̠æ̃tɕi/ 鬟 </p>
	<h1>Syllabic consonants</h1>
	<p> There are 3 syllabic consonants: /ʋ̩/, /ɹ̩/ and /ɹ̠̍/.
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">A</p2> is pronounced /ʋ̩/ after w and f:
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">wA</p2> /ʋʋ̩/ 乌
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">fA</p2> /fʋ̩/ 负
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">E</p2> is pronounced /ɹ̩/ after z,
		<p2 class="xdi8">D</p2> ,
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2> , s and r:
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">zE</p2> /tsɹ̩/ 只
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">DE</p2> /tsʰɹ̩/ 也
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">HE</p2> /nzɹ̩/ 质
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">sE</p2> /sɹ̩/ 是
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">rE</p2> /ɹɹ̩/ 日
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">1s</p2> is pronounced /ɹ̩/ after l, d and t.
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">iA</p2> is pronounced /ɹ̠̍/ after w and f, and is pronounced like the glide /ɹ̠/:
		<br>
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">wiA</p2> /ʋɹ̠̍/ 五
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">fiA</p2> /fɹ̠̍/ 胡
		<br>
		<br> There are also two syllabic consonants that are not commonly used:
		<br> m /m̩/, used in Shiddin Mandarin
		<p2 class="xdi8">mmT</p2> /m̩mɐ̃/ “mom, mother; the sound of a young cow calling its mother”
		<br>
		<p2 class="xdi8">N</p2> /ŋ̍/, usedin Shiddin Shaoyang dialect to show negation, as in
		<p2 class="xdi8">Nda</p2> /ŋ̍ta/ “not big”.
		<br>
		<br> The two syllabic consonants above are not used in Standard Shiddin. </p>

		<p2 class="xdi8">T</p2> /ɐ̃/,

	<h1>Syllable structure and other phonological features</h1>
	<p>The syllable structures of Shidinn are is usually CGV(or a syllabic consonant) (more exactly: CV, CVC, CVV, CCV, CCVV and VCV. Vowels can be diphthongs), and multiple syllables form a word. Glides don’t have to appear, and consonants and vowels don’t have to appear (but at the same time), but it can’t just be a glide and a vowel.
		<br>
		<br>Shidinn alphabetic languages have no tones. One of the important goals of Shidinn is to eliminate homophones, which is the reason there aren't any. Shidinn has stress, like when reading the names of the letters, the stress lands on the first syllable. A-da is pronounced /'a da/, and X-b is pronounced /'ɕi bo/. Apart from stress, Shidinn has Mandarin dialects (like Hunan dialect and Shaoyang dialect), so when reading, the intonations sound like tones. However, no matter what tones are used when reading the Shidinn, the meanings are always the same.</p>
	<h1>Features of Shidinn</h1>
	<p>Shidinn has a few unique features:
		<br><b>It excludes the lateral /l/ in its set of alveolar consonants, and emphasises the nasal /n/ and its variants.</b> In Shidinn, v and l represents /n/ and n represents /ɲ/. There is also the letter
		<p2 class="xdi8">N</p2>, which is pronounced /ŋ/.
		<br><b>There are no retroflex sounds.</b>
		<br><b>Alveolar and velar nasals are combined into a nasalized vowel.</b> The pronunciations of Shidinn nasals are nasalized vowels. For example, the letter
		<p2 class="xdi8">T</p2> (corresponding to Mandarin “ang” with the velar nasal) is pronounced /ɑ̃/, as in French sans /sɑ̃/. The letter
		<p2 class="xdi8">2</p2> (corresponding to Mandarin “an” with the alveolar nasal) is pronounced /æ̃/.
		<br>
		<br>Shidinn has a few more features compared to Pinyin:
		<br> <b>Some letters from Pinyin are taken and modified.</b> For example: c in Pinyin is moved to Shidinn as
		<p2 class="xdi8">D</p2>, the phoneme is still kept (/tsʰ/), but the pronunciation rules are different.
		<br><b>Some glides such as -i- and -u- are removed in writing.</b> Consonants j, q and x can be directly combined with vowels, like when “国家” (Pinyin: guójiā) is written as goja in the Shidinn Mandarin, but the pronunciation still keeps the glide -i- (/go t͡ɕia/, the glide -u- is removed entirely).
		<br><b>Some phonemes and usages are added.</b> Examples of this include /nz/ (written as
		<p2 class="xdi8">H</p2>, and is sometimes pronounced as /ʐ/. This can be analyzed as a dialectal reading) and /ŋ/ (written as
		<p2 class="xdi8">N</p2>), which can be placed at the onset of a syllable. </p>
